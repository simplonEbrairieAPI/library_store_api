# Git rules
- main branch is the final version for the client, we can merge dev on it.
- dev branch is the  branch production. Create your new branch from this point only if dev is update, otherwise do a git pull to update dev branch.

- 'branchfeature': this branch is name by my feature, on what your work
when you finish with your branch => git push set--upstream blabla

=> then got on github with your browser and make a pull request
of your branch to dev

dev  <--  branchfeature ask a pull request

Someone of your team as to validate your pull request.

### !!!!!!Never work directly on DEV or on MAIN branch!!!!!
